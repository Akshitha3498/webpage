    <h1>TYPES OF FORESTS AROUND THE WORLD</h1>
    <p>
    Forests cover 1/3 of the earthâ€™s surface and contain an estimated 3 trillion trees.<br>
    Forests exist in dry, wet, bitterly cold, and swelteringly hot climates.<br>
    These different forests all have special characteristics that allow them to thrive in their particular climate.<br>
    Broadly speaking, there are three major forest zones that are separated according to their distance from the equator.<br>
    These are:<br>
    the tropical,temperate,and boreal forests (taiga).There are also more specific types of forests within these larger regions.
